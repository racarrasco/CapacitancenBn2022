# CapacitancenBn2022
## Description of Files:
1. CVData.xlsx - File containing the capacitance-voltage data of an InAs/InAsSb device nBn. The first row is header information and a note on the data. The second row contains column information of the file. Column 1 is the applied voltage in Volts, the second column is the measured capacitance file in Farads, and the third column is the measured conductance.
2. CapacitanceVoltageFit.py - File containing the functions to model the capacitance-voltage sweep of a device nBn. It also contains the function to fit to a measured capacitance-voltage curve.
3. Figure1Data.xlsx - File containing simulated data from Silvaco of a sample nBn.
